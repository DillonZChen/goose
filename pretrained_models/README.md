# Pretrained GOOSE models
These are models trained for benchmarks used in our ICAPS'24 and NeurIPS'24 paper.
The models were trained with [WLPlan](https://github.com/DillonZChen/wlplan) `v2.0.0` and [GOOSE](https://github.com/DillonZChen/goose) `v2.0.0`.
`ipc23lt` models are trained with the [classic.toml](/configurations/classic.toml) configuration and `neurips24` models are trained with the [numeric.toml](/configurations/numeric.toml) configuration.
