# Pathways (Propositional, STRIPS)

## Domain Description

This domain is inspired by the field of molecular biology, and specifically biochemical pathways.
“A pathway is a sequence of chemical reactions in a biological organism.
Such pathways specify mechanisms that explain how cells carry out their major functions by means of molecules and reactions that produce regular changes.
Many diseases can be explained by defects in pathways, and new treatments often involve finding drugs that correct those defects” [1].
We can model parts of the functioning of a pathway as a planning problem by simply representing chemical reactions as actions.

The biochemical pathway domain of the competition is based on the pathway of the mammalian cell cycle control, as it described in [2] and [modelled in BIOCHAM](http://contraintes.inria.fr/BIOCHAM/EXAMPLES/cell_cycle/cell_cycle.bc).
There are 3 different kinds of basic actions corresponding to the different kinds of reactions that appear in the pathway.
