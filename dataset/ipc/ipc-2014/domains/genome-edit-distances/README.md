# Genome Edit Distances (Sequential, Optimal)

## Domain Description

The *genome edit distances* problem is to find a minimal-cost sequence of operations that transforms one genome (signed permutation of genes) into another.
The purpose of this is to use this cost as a measure of the distance between the two genomes, which is used to construct hypotheses about the evolutionary relationship between the organisms.

There is a [description paper](https://helios.hud.ac.uk/scommv/IPC-14/repository/GED.pdf) with additional details on this domain.
