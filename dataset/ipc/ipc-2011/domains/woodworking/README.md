## Domain Description

There is no description of this domain in the last IPC.
It simulates the works in a woodworking workshop where there is some quantity of wood that has to be polished, colored, etc. using different tools with different costs.
Parameters of each problem are the parts to be done and the quantity (in percentage of necessary) of available wood (boards). The higher the number of parts and boards, the more difficult the problem is.
