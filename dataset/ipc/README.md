# PDDL Benchmark Instances

> PDDL instances covering the International Planning Competitions

## Overview

This repository contains PDDL benchmark instances in a **consistent structure.**

Currently, this repository covers the benchmark instances of the **International Planning Competitions** (IPC).

## Format

For each IPC domain, there is a top-level readme containing an informal description of the domain.

Problem instances reside in the `instances` subdirectory and are of the form `instance-x.pddl`, where `x` â‰¥ 1 (without leading zeros).

With most domains, there is only one domain description for all instances, `domain.pddl`.
In some cases, a proper domain is provided for each instance, in which case the domain descriptions are stored in a `domains` subdirectory.

## International Planning Competitions

The following International Planning Competitions are completely covered unless otherwise stated.
