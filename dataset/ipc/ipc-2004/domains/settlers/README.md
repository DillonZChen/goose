# Settlers (STRIPS)

## Domain Description

Introduced by Maria Fox and Derek Long in IPC-3.
The domain, i.e., its test suite, could not be solved efficiently by any of the IPC-3 participants.
We reused the domain with no modifications whatsoever, except removing some quantified effects (that could easily be replaced with lists of non-quantified effects).
