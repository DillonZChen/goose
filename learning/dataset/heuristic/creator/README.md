There is a lot of scattered classes here because the codebase was originally built under the assumption of classical planning only which is what mimir supports. However, we now want to do numeric planning which mimir does not support. Thus, it's probably easier and safer to reimplement numeric versions of classes using different parsers and successor generators rather than refactor everything.
