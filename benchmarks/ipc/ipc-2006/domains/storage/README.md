# Storage (Propositional)

## Domain Description

*Storage* is a planning domain involving spatial reasoning.
Basically, the domain is about moving a certain number of crates from some containers to some depots by hoists.
Inside a depot, each hoist can move according to a specified spatial map connecting different areas of the depot.
The test problems for this domain involve different numbers of depots, hoists, crates, containers, and depot areas.
At the beginning of each problem file, we give the spatial map of the depot areas.
While in this domain, it is important to generate plans of good quality, for many test problems, even finding any solution can be quite hard for domain-independent planners.
