# Gripper (Round 1, STRIPS)

## Domain Description

There is a robot with two grippers.
It can carry a ball in each.
The goal is to take N balls from one room to another; N rises with problem number.
Some planners treat the two grippers asymmetrically, giving rise to an unnecessary combinatorial explosion.
