# Movie (Round 1, STRIPS)

## Domain Description

In this domain, the goal is always the same (to have lots of snacks in order to watch a movie), but the number of constants increases with problem number.
Some planners have combinatorial problems in such cases.

## Authors

Corin Anderson

## Additional Notes

There are two slight different versions of the domain ([version 1][1], [version 2][2]).
As it is unclear which version is considered official, version 1 was selected because it avoids an empty conjunction.
